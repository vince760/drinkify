# UI Coding Exercise #

The purpose of this exercise is to test your familiarity with full-stack development. You'll be building a small cocktail drinks listing app using frameworks of your choice and the Cocktaildb public API.

### Functional Requirements ###

* The user should be presented with a cocktail drink listing page where the user can search with an input field and a search button
* In the listing page, present any information from the JSON, which you think would be useful for a user
* Clicking the search button triggers a search to the the cocktaildb's API and displays the results on the screen
* Clicking on the item in the listing or search results, user is presented with the details of that drink
* The results should be sortable by name
* List can be filtered by category or glass


### System Requirements ###

* The client-side application can be written in any Javascript framework
* You may use any additional libraries that you see fit
* UI should be presentable(Be creative)


### APIâ€™s to be called ###
